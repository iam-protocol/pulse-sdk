/**
 * MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) feature extraction.
 *
 * MFCCs are the industry-standard speaker-recognition feature: they encode
 * the SHAPE of the vocal tract via cepstral coefficients on a perceptual
 * mel-frequency scale. Two adult humans speaking the same word produce
 * different MFCC trajectories the same way two violins produce different
 * timbres of the same note. The original 44-feature audio block omitted
 * MFCCs entirely — this is the largest single discriminative-power gap
 * the v2 feature pipeline closes (see
 * `docs/master/BLUEPRINT-feature-pipeline-v2.md` §1.1).
 *
 * Output of `extractMfccFeatures` is 78 statistical aggregates over the
 * per-frame MFCC time-series captured during a 12-second session:
 *
 *   - 13 MFCC coefficients × 4 stats (mean, var, skewness, kurtosis) = 52
 *   - 13 delta-MFCC coefficients × 2 stats (mean, var) = 26
 *
 * The deltas (first-order temporal derivatives via 9-frame regression
 * window) capture how the vocal tract shape CHANGES during articulation —
 * a complementary identity signal to the static MFCCs.
 *
 * @privacyGuarantee MFCCs are themselves a dimensionality reduction (FFT →
 * mel filter bank → log → DCT, keeping the first 13 coefficients). The
 * statistics across frames add a second reduction layer. Aggregated
 * MFCC stats cannot reconstruct intelligible audio without a separate
 * vocoder model, and even with one only a coarse approximation is
 * possible. This is the same privacy posture as the existing 44-feature
 * audio block: statistical aggregates of on-device-computed signals.
